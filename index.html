    </p>
    <p>
      This application was written in Python and is an aide to use when playing Wordle.<br>

      <strong>Eliminate</strong> allows you to remove any letters you know are not in the word.<br>
      <strong>Possible</strong> allows you to add any letters that you know are in the word but do not yet know the exact position.<br>
      <strong>Duplicate</strong> allows you to insert any letter that you know has more than one appearance in the word.<br>
      <strong>Eliminate Possible</strong> allows you to remove any letters you know are in the word from positions you know they do not go.<br>
      <strong>Eliminate Duplicate</strong> allows you to clarify if you know that a known letter only appears once in the word.<br>
      <strong>Insert</strong> allows you to confirm any letter into its known final position.<br>
      Also included are the <strong>Generate</strong> and <strong>Reset</strong> options.<br>
      <strong>Generate</strong> uses all of the currently collected information to filter the list of all words down to a list that meets the current specifications.<br>
